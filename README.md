## My Gigs

As an indie hacker with a background in software engineering and with an avid appetite for innovation I have a keen interest in spotting untapped market niches.
I self-built a diverse array of small products ranging from dating apps to Web3 Dapps, and from a network of gaming websites to fully developed games and gaming platforms.

My favorite tech gear: JavaScript | React | Node.js | Firebase | EVM Chains
